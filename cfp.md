**Big Data Mining (KDD BigMine-19)**   
The 8th International Workshop on Big Data on Streams and Heterogeneous Source Mining - A KDD2018 Workshop
   
KDD2018 Conference Dates: August 4-8, 2019  
Workshop Date: Aug 5, 2019  
Anchorage, Alaska - USA

Scope
-----

The goal of the workshop is to provide a forum to discuss important research questions and practical challenges in big data mining and related areas. Novel ideas, controversial issues, open problems and comparisons of competing approaches are strongly encouraged. Representation of alternative viewpoints and discussions are also strongly encouraged. 

We invite submission of papers describing innovative research on all aspects of big data mining. Work-in-progress papers, demos, and visionary papers are also welcome.

Papers emphasizing theoretical foundations, algorithms, systems, applications, language issues, data storage and access, architecture are particularly encouraged.


Topics
------

Examples of topics of interest include

* Scalable, Distributed and Parallel Algorithms
* Designing light足weighted data mining algorithm
* New Programming Model for Large Data beyond Hadoop/MapReduce, STORM, streaming languages
* Federated training using data from multiple devices
* Mining Algorithms of Data in non-traditional formats (unstructured, semi-structured)
* Applications: social media, Internet of Things, Smart Grid, Smart Transportation Systems
* Streaming Data Processing
* Heterogeneous Sources and Format Mining
* Privacy issues of on-足device user data
* Systems Issues related to large datasets: clouds, streaming system, architecture, and issues beyond cloud and streams.
* System and platform for on足-device learning
* Interfaces to database systems and analytics.
* Evaluation Technologies
* Integrating the design of human 足computer interaction with machinelearning algorithms
* Visualization for Big Data
* Applications: Large scale recommendation systems, social media systems, social network systems, scientific data mining, environmental, urban and other large data mining applications.


Submission
----------

Submitted papers will be assessed based on their novelty, technical quality, potential impact, and clarity of writing. For papers that rely heavily on empirical evaluations, the experimental methods and results should be clear, well executed, and repeatable. Authors are strongly encouraged to make data and code publicly available whenever possible.
