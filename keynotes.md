## Manik Varma (Microsoft Research India) -  The Extremes of Machine Learning

I will discuss extremely large and extremely small scale machine learning in this talk. I will start by introducing extreme classification – a new area of research focusing on multi-class & multi-label problem involving millions of categories. Extreme classification has opened a new paradigm for thinking about key applications in our industry. I will discuss algorithms for some of these applications and present results on tagging on Wikipedia, product recommendation on Amazon and search and advertising on the Bing search engine. More details can be found on The Extreme Classification Repository at http://manikvarma.org/downloads/XC/XMLRepository.html

In the second part of my talk, I will propose an alternative paradigm for the Internet of Things (IoT) where machine learning algorithms run locally on extremely  resource-constrained edge and endpoint devices without necessarily needing cloud connectivity. This enables many scenarios beyond the pale of the traditional paradigm including low-latency brain implants, precision agriculture on disconnected farms, privacy-preserving smart spectacles, etc. Towards this end, I will discuss developing novel machine learning algorithms that can run on cheap and extremely energy efficient microcontrollers smaller than a grain of rice having just 2 KB RAM with no hardware support for floating point operations. Source code for these algorithms is publicly available as part of Microsoft’s Edge Machine Learning library from https://github.com/Microsoft/EdgeML

| *Bio*: Manik Varma is a principal researcher at Microsoft Research India and an adjunct professor of computer science at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi. His research interests lie in the areas of machine learning, computational advertising and computer vision. Classifiers that he has developed have been deployed on millions of devices around the world and have protected them from viruses and malware. His algorithms are also generating millions of dollars on the Bing search engine (up to sign ambiguity). In 2013, he and John Langford coined the term extreme classification and found that they had inadvertently started a new area in machine learning. Today, by happenstance, extreme classification is thriving in both academia and industry with Manik’s classifiers being used in various Microsoft products as well as in the wider tech sector. Manik recently proclaimed “2 KB (RAM) ought to be enough for everybody” prompting the media in the US, India, China, France, Belgium and Singapore to cover his research and compare him to Bill Gates (unfair, Manik’s more handsome!). Manik has been awarded the Microsoft Gold Star award, the Microsoft Achievement award, won the PASCAL VOC Object Detection Challenge and stood first in chicken chess tournaments and Pepsi drinking competitions. He has served as an area chair/senior PC member for machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision conferences such as AAAI, CVPR, ICCV, ICML, IJCAI and NIPS and is  serving as an associate editor of the IEEE PAMI journal. Manik is also a failed physicist (BSc St. Stephen's College, David Raja Ram Prize), theoretician (BA Oxford, Rhodes Scholar), engineer (DPhil Oxford, University Scholar) and mathematician (MSRI Berkeley, Post-doctoral Fellow) |  | 


## Geoff Webb (Monash University) -  Learning in a dynamic and ever changing world

The world is dynamic – in a constant state of flux – but most learned models
are static. Models learned from historical data are likely to decline in
accuracy over time.  I will present our recent work on how to address this
serious issue that confronts many real-world applications of machine
learning.  Methodology: we are developing objective quantitative measures of
drift and effective techniques for assessing them from sample data. Theory:
we posit a strong relationship between drift rate, optimal forgetting rate
and optimal bias/variance profile, with the profound implication that the
fundamental nature of a learning algorithm should ideally change as drift
rate changes. Techniques: we have developed the Extremely Fast Decision
Tree, a statistically more efficient variant of the incremental learning
workhorse, the Very Fast Decision Tree.

| *Bio*: Geoff Webb is a leading data scientist. He is Director of the Monash
University Centre for Data Science and a Technical Advisor to data science
startups FROOMLE and BigML Inc. The latter have incorporated his best of
class association discovery software, Magnum Opus, as a core component of
their advanced Machine Learning service. He developed many of the key
mechanisms of support-confidence association discovery in the late 1980s.
His OPUS search algorithm remains the state-of-the-art in rule search. He
pioneered multiple research areas as diverse as black-box user modelling,
interactive data analytics and statistically-sound pattern discovery.  He
has developed many useful machine learning algorithms that are widely
deployed.  He was editor in chief of the premier data mining journal, Data
Mining and Knowledge Discovery from 2005 to 2014. He has been Program
Committee Chair of the two top data mining conferences, ACM SIGKDD and IEEE
ICDM, as well as General Chair of ICDM. He is an IEEE Fellow. His many
awards include the inaugural Australian Museum Eureka Prize for Excellence
in Data Science. |  | 


## Sašo Džeroski (Jozef Stefan Institute and the Centre of Excellence for Integrated Approaches in Chemistry and Biology of Proteins, Ljubljana, Slovenia) - Multi-target prediction on data streams

Starting from tree-based regression methods for data streams, we have developed a number of approaches for on-line multi-target prediction. These cover different multi-target prediction tasks such as multi-target regression, multi-label classification and hierarchical versions of these tasks. These also cover a range of tree-based methods, including individual decision trees, option trees and tree ensembles (bagging and random forests). Finally, we have recently also addressed the task of semi-supervised multi-target prediction on data streams. The talk will give an overview of these developments, based on on-line learning of predictive clustering trees, and discuss further research in this area (incl. change detection and feature ranking).

## Latifur Khan (Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at Dallas) - Data to Knowledge: Modernizing Political Event Data for Big Data Social Science Research

We have developed the software and big data infrastructure to provide machine coded event data from news reports from historical and real-time inputs from the web. The project is ongoing and will produce coded news reports based on NLP applications across English, Spanish, and Arabic news reports. Human annotations and validations are conducted for data validation and cross-lingual support. Geo-location of the events is also improved for better spatial resolutions. 
One of the main computational challenges we address in this work is related to the efficiency and scalability of parsing online news articles in real-time. In particular, we designed a distributed system with Apache Spark and Kafka to process large amount of news articles for event coders and the actor recommender system. This system processes articles in near real-time while generating events which are provided to end users using our REST API at http://eventdata.utdallas.edu.

This is a collaborative work with political scientists, Dr. Patrick Brandt and Dr. Jennifer Holmes, funded by NSF.
